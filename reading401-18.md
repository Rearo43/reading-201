# Socket.io

- What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
  > The ability to easily and quickly said mass amounts of data.
- UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
  > You can transmit data without connections established between source and destination.
- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
  > Yes this is possible on any port (same/diff).
- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
  > Yes
- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
  > ???
### Term
- OSI Model
- TCP Model
- TCP: (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other [used](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP#:~:text=TCP%20(Transmission%20Control%20Protocol)%20is,of%20data%20to%20each%20other)
- UDP: (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party [used](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol#:~:text=UDP%20(User%20Datagram%20Protocol)%20is,provided%20by%20the%20receiving%20party)
- Packets: control information and user data (payloads)
- Socket: connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other
