# Javascript Templating & Mustache

> Templating helps front end and back end work together so both can do their part without the whole page falling apart. For example if the backend wants to change the img's being loaded or the amout of img they can do so. If the img's are no longer avalible the front end can also change the code in the front and it wont affect or break the JS.
