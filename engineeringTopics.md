# Prep: Engineering Topics

When solving a problem force yourself to completely forget about writing code. Read the problem through a couple times and make sure you really understand what is being asked. An example is read a problem over make sure you know if the original array can me mutated or not. Ask as many questions as you can and write them down. Solve the problem verbally written in english. The come up with small achievable steps. If the question is asking you to split an array in half until you find a target number. Instead of going right to the target number figure out how to split an array in half. With that being said not only do you have to split the array in half the returned value is going to have to be a index number. So how do you get an index number. So right there we already have multiple questions and steps (Split an array, check if thats the target value, if not split is the number greater or less, split array again and so on). When solving a problem coding should be your last thought.
