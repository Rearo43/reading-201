# Chapter 16: “Images” and Chapter 19: “Practical Information”

### Images

- images can be controlled for size by width and height but if you change both independently you will make the picture look distorted 
- you can float an image left and right to have text wrap around
- centering an image you can use display block and set the margin to auto
- images can be used for background and can be repeated 
- you can use fixed on the image an it will stay in the same place or you can use scroll and that image will follow the user down the page

### Practical Information

- you can use key words to help your findability on you page in the url, headings, title, and page description to name a couple
- when picking keywords do a little research in to how much competition you will have and use that information to hone in on a couple words you want to focus on
- you can use analytics to see at what rate are people coming to your sight and if they've returned plus the amount of time spent on your page and where they are from
