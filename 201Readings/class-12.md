# Charts.js Article 
> The article pretty much gave an over view on how to implament the charts and different styles you can use. When looking at the actual website you can make anything you can think of. The amount of control you have over the charts is significant.


### Basic Usage
> You have to have canvas tags and it's smart to have backup content so if a browser doesn't support the graph the user still knows what's going on.

### Drawing Shapes With Canvas
> Shapes are possible by using points on a grid to dictate where you want the lines to go stop and meet up. You can do this by using the functions moveTo, arc, lineTo, ect.

### Applying Styles and Colors
> Very similar to CSS you have strokeStyle (outline) and fillStyle (fill) and you use the same rbg values.

### Drawing Text
> You can use fillText (solid) and strokeText (outline) to change the text appearance. And stlye using direction, font, textAlign and textBaseline.
