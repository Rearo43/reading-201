# Local Storage

- LS is free and can hold a lot but it will only be stored on said computer and can not be seen from another
- you have to use JSON to make the data able to store JSON.stringify()
- if it is not stringified said content will not store
- localStorage.clear clears storage
- key has to be a string
- localstorage.setItem() = put item in LS
- localstorage.getItem() = get item out of LS
- localStorage = in console showes local storage
- when writing your code you also turn your now JSON code back into JS using Json.parse() now normal array of objects no longer connected to constructor
