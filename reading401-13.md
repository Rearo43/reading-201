Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint
What can you do with an authorization code?
#### What can you do with an access token?
  > You can make API requests, and use them to keep track of how many times or who it using your site/ code.
#### Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
  > Because the code is already written and someone else has dedicated a lot of time to make it secure.
