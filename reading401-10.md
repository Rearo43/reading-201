# Implementation: Stacks and Queues
## STACKS
### Stack Flow
#### `FILO` - `F`irst `I`n `L`ast `O`ut
#### `LIFO` - `L`ast `I`n `F`irst `O`ut
### Terminology
  - Push: Nodes put into the stack **Push O(1)**
  - Pop: Nodes removed from the stack **Pop O(1)**
    > When there is an empty stack an exception should be raised
  - Top: Top of stack
  - Peek: View value of the top Node **Peek O(1)**
    > When there is an empty stack an exception should be raised
  - IsEmpty: Boolean **IsEmpty O(1)**

## QUEUES
### Queue Flow
#### `FIFO` - `F`irst `I`n `F`irst `O`ut
#### `LILO` - `L`ast `I`n `L`ast `O`ut
### Terminology
  - Enqueue: Nodes that are added **Enqueue O(1)**
  - Dequeue: Nodes that are removed **Dequeue O(1)**
    > When there is an empty queue an exception should be raised
  - Front: This is the first Node
  - Rear: This is the last Node
  - Peek: View value of the front Node **Peek O(1)**
    > When there is an empty queue an exception should be raised
  - IsEmpty: Boolean **IsEmpty O(1)**
