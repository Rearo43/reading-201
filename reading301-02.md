# Jquery
> JQ is like short hand for javascript you have to get the the JQ "file" by using script tags at the end of your HTML but before any file that needs to just JQ.
- $ is pretty much like saying jquery do blank that's why the $ sign is everywhere. $('table') --> table is now a JQ object. If there were multiple tables they would all be targeted.
- Looping in JQ can be done to multiple elements at the same time. You can also chain methods in one line.
- just like a for loop and running through each thing in an array you can use .each()
