# Props and State

Does a deployed React application require a server?
  > No beacuse the build can be run enabling said app to be used with a static website.
  
Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  > Because with react there are not as many single functions and more classes. Unit test are better for technology while behavior test are good for business facing test (having front end).
  
What does npm run build do?
  > Runs the React app using the build folder to do so. This also enables the app to run faster than a vanilla javascript app.
  
Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
  > First components, then rendering, and then the UI.

### Term
- BDD: behavior-driven development
- Acceptance Tests: These types of test ensure that an app is running as expected prior to being able to merge
- mounting: inserted into the tree, output of a component into the UI representation
- build: enables the app to run to run faster, with "putting" all css into a file and same with javascript so the application can run faster
