# Linked Lists
> Have you listened to music lately?

Linked lists can be looked at like the music app Pandora

Pandora when the app was first released allowed you to pick a genre of music and then listen to a randomized playlist. Before all the upgrades the user would be able to view two pieces of information __The current song (value of node) and the next song to be played (value of next).__ Past that the user was not able to see what has previously been played and what was going to play any number of songs past the next one. In this analogy you can see the screen of the app as the node (on each screen you can only see two pieces of info value, and next) or you can see the user as the node (and each time the user listens to another song they become a new node).
