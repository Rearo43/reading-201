# Heroku and Deployment

> Used to deploy web app so they can be seen worldwide. 

- You have to make a node.js file
> In there you can put reqirments to grab certain files (express in this case) as well as which port (3000 in this case). This will make it possible to now test that it works in your terminal vs console. 
- Now we're going to use Heroku to enable www(world wide web)
- We use git init when you're in your project folder... then AC but not P we will then do heroku create and then P ex. git push heroku master.
- Form there you can the app is running (heroku ps:scale web=1) and rename (heroku apps:rename)
- And very last heroku open will now open your project looking something like this in the url (https://somename.herokuapp.com/.
